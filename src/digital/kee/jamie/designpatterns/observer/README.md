# The Observer Pattern

Welcome to my implementation of the observer pattern.

In the example here I take you through implementing the observer pattern for whenever an order has been placed.

The structure follows this:
 - /problem - This highlights the problem code that the observer pattern can help out with.
 - /solution - This is the solution to fix the above problem using the observer pattern
 - /microservices - This is using the solution but adapting the code to see what it would look like in a microservice environment.
